#summary Why some captchas are so easy to break


= Details =

Here are some of the reasons why some captchas are really really easy to break.

  * Background is the same color. No gradient or patterns.
  * Font is not distorted.
  * Letters are all nicely next to each other and always at the same place.

So if you want to make it harder then.

  * Have a changing background. Add gradients, patterns etc and make sure the background is different every single time.
  * Distort the font or at least write the letters randomly across the image without a specific pattern.
